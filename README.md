# Generate My README!

## Description
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project. 


## Usage
Having a high quality README is an important aspect of open source projects! This README generator works in the command-line by accepting input from the user. 

The command line will ask a series of questions. When input is received, the command-line app will create a README with the following information: 
 * The title of the project 
      * Description 
      * Table of Contents 
      * Installation 
      * Usage 
      * License 
      * Contributing 
      * Tests 
      * Questions
